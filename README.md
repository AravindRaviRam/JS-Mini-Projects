# JS - Mini Projects

This repository holds my JS made mini projects.

1. Password Generator + Strength Checker
- It generates random string of length 8 from a character pool of  alphanumerics + symbols. As for the strength checker, it checks if the password has Lowecase letters ( a-z ), Uppercase Letters ( A-Z ), Numbers ( 0-9 ) and Symbols.

2. Clock Using P5.js
- Using P5.js I generated clock hand and mapped them to rotate acc. to sec, min, hour.

3. Particle System Using P5.js
- I've used Object Oriented Js mixed with P5.js library. Each particle is an object itself and in collectively is generated randomly at random location with random colors. The strokes only appear if two particle are 75 units aparts in distance.

6. Linear Array Sorting
- Setting the first element of the array aas max and then comparing it with rest of elements, and repeating the same process till the array has an order.

7. Pascal Triangle Visualized
- Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients and at the same it will be shown that the sum of the entries in the n-th diagonal of Pascal's triangle is equal to the n-th Fibonacci number for all positive integers n.
