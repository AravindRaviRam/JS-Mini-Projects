# JS - Mini Projects

This repository holds my JS made mini projects.

1. Password Generator + Strength Checker
- It generates random string of length 8 from a character pool of  alphanumerics + symbols. As for the strength checker, it checks if the password has Lowecase letters ( a-z ), Uppercase Letters ( A-Z ), Numbers ( 0-9 ) and Symbols.

3. Particle System Using P5.js
- I've used Object Oriented Js mixed with P5.js library. Each particle is an object itself and in collectively is generated randomly at random location with random colors. The strokes only appear if two particle are 75 units aparts in distance.
