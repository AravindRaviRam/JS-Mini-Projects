# JS - Mini Projects

This repository holds my JS made mini projects.

1. Password Generator + Strength Checker | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/pen/xXGYdp">Codepen</a>
- It generates random string of length 8 from a character pool of  alphanumerics + symbols. As for the strength checker, it checks if the password has Lowecase letters ( a-z ), Uppercase Letters ( A-Z ), Numbers ( 0-9 ) and Symbols.

2. Clock Using P5.js | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/pen/rGLbvK">Codepen</a>
- Using P5.js I generated clock hand and mapped them to rotate acc. to sec, min, hour.

3. Particle System Using P5.js | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/pen/QvoVPw">Codepen</a>
- I've used Object Oriented Js mixed with P5.js library. Each particle is an object itself and in collectively is generated randomly at random location with random colors. The strokes only appear if two particle are 75 units aparts in distance.

4. Factorial Generator | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/full/MEQRJj">Codepen</a>
- It was so basic that it needs no explanation.

5. Fibonacci Sequence Generator | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/full/YraGjR">Codepen</a>
- It essentially takes a number from the user upto which the fibonacci sequence should run and it evaluates the values. 

6. Linear Array Sorting | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/pen/LzrRGR">Codepen</a>
- Setting the first element of the array as max and then comparing it with rest of elements, and repeating the same process till the array has an order.

7. Pascal Triangle Visualized | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/full/oGPWze">Codepen</a>
- Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients and at the same it will be shown that the sum of the entries in the n-th diagonal of Pascal's triangle is equal to the n-th Fibonacci number for all positive integers n.

8. Just Another Todo App | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/pen/MEPmyd">Codepen</a>
- The app let's the user add tasks, edit tasks and delete tasks.

9. Prime Generator | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/full/OQZRrL">Codepen</a> 
- A prime number is a natural number that is divisible by 1 and itself. This demo let's you input a number and it will either generate prime numbers upto that number or tells you if it's a prime or not.

10. Matrix Multiplication | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/full/gvKLvp">Codepen</a>
- The user has to first input size for both matrices and then the elements of each matrix can be entered which is validated against the multiple of the size given for each matrix respectively. Then simple using three nested loops it performs matrix multiplication and stores the resultant matrix.

11. Fractional Knapsack using Greedy Approach | <a href="https://codepen.io/prvnbist/pen/PeaVEX">Codepen</a>
- Fractional Knapsack Problem says that, Given a knapsack of capacity W, we have a set of items with weight w(i) and profit(i), we have to maximize the profit without exceeding the knapsack capacity and we can also take the fraction of an item.
